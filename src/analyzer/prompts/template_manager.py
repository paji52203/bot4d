   Identify unswept liquidity pools above/below.

2. VOLUME ANALYSIS:
   BOS/Trigger candle volume vs 20-period average: [X]x average.
   Anti-Dump Status: [Buy dominant | Sell dominant | Neutral]

3. VETO CHECK:
   RSI: [value] → [Clear | VETOED - reason]
   ADX: [value] → [Clear >20 | VETOED <20]
   Result: [PASS | VETOED]

4. POSITION STATE:
   Open position: [YES/NO]
   Action: [Proceed to entry | HOLD | UPDATE trailing stop | CLOSE immediately]

5. RISK/REWARD (required for BUY/SELL/UPDATE):
   Entry: [price] — [exact trigger condition]
   SL: [price] — at [exact structural level where thesis is invalidated]
   TP: [price] — at [structural liquidity pool target]
   R/R calc: risk=|entry-SL|, reward=|TP-entry|. For UPDATE: risk=|current_price-SL|
   R/R ratio: [X]:1 (minimum 1.5:1 required, else output HOLD)
   Fee check: Expected gross >= 0.3%? [YES/NO]
   Position size (show your work):
     Base = confidence / 100
     Tier: confidence 55-69 → x0.6 | 70-84 → x1.0 | 85-100 → x1.2
     ADX 20-25: apply x0.7 | MACRO CAUTION: apply x0.5
     Final = max(0.10, min(0.50, base x tier x adjustments))

6. FINAL DECISION: [SIGNAL] — Confidence [X]/100
   One sentence: why this signal + exact invalidation condition.

⚠️ CRITICAL JSON RULES:
- HOLD/CLOSE: set entry_price, stop_loss, and take_profit to 0.0

CONFLUENCE SCORING GUIDE (0-100, rate how strongly each factor supports signal):
- structure_clarity:      100=crystal clear BOS/CHOCH | 50=ambiguous | 0=no structure
- volume_confirmation:    100=>2x avg | 75=1.5-2x (minimum valid) | 0=<1.5x (fakeout risk)
- trend_alignment:        100=1H+4H both aligned | 60=1H only | 30=neutral | 0=opposing
- veto_clear:             100=RSI 30-70 + ADX>25 | 50=near extreme | 0=VETOED → output HOLD
- liquidity_pool_quality: 100=clean untouched swing | 50=partially tested | 0=arbitrary TP

[BAGIAN 4 — SIGNAL EXECUTION RULES]

TRADING SIGNALS (Gate-Based System):
- BUY/SELL: All 3 gates must pass → BOS confirmed + Volume >1.5x avg + Veto CLEAR
  R/R ≥ 1.5:1 required. Confidence tier determines position SIZE, not whether to enter.
- ANTI-HESITATION: BOS confirmed + Volume confirmed + Veto cleared → EXECUTE at confidence 55+.
  The BOS IS the signal. Do not wait for further confirmation candles.
- HOLD: Any gate failed | R/R < 1.5:1 | No clear structure | Fee check fails (<0.3% gross)
- CLOSE: Opposite BOS closed against open position → EXIT immediately. No averaging down.
- UPDATE: Profit >0.5% → trail SL to last swing structure. Signal UPDATE every candle while profitable.

RISK MANAGEMENT (Structural SL/TP Placement):
LONG: SL just below BOS origin candle's low or last HL (max 1.5% from entry)
      TP at next unswept swing HIGH / liquidity pool (target 1%-3%)
SHORT: SL just above BOS origin candle's high or last LH (max 1.5% from entry)
       TP at next unswept swing LOW / liquidity pool (target 1%-3%)
⛔ If structural SL requires >1.5% from entry → output HOLD. Setup risk is too wide.

DYNAMIC TRAILING (UPDATE Signal):
Trigger: Open position profit >0.5%
Action: Move SL to most recent structural swing (HL for LONG, LH for SHORT)
Trail tighter each candle check. Never move SL away from profit direction.
Continue UPDATE signals until TP is hit or opposite BOS occurs.

HIGH-IMPACT EVENT PROTOCOL (replaces 365D Macro Conflict):
Sudden candle >2% in ONE bar WITHOUT a preceding BOS setup → DO NOT chase.
This is likely news-driven, not structural. Wait for new BOS to form before entering.
If a high-volume news candle fires hard AGAINST an open position → treat as CLOSE signal immediately.
News can invalidate structural analysis instantly. Capital defense > being right.'''

Step 5 → Section 3 (CONTEXT & CATALYST)
Step 5.5 → Section 3.5 (SCENARIO ANALYSIS)
Step 6 → Sections 3 + 5 (NEWS & historical evidence in CONTEXT and DECISION)
Step 7 → Section 2.5 (QUANTITATIVE & VISUAL VALIDATION)
Step 8 (if chart) → Section 2.5 (chart sub-section)
Synthesis → Sections 4 + 5 (RISK/REWARD + DECISION)

1. MULTI-TIMEFRAME ASSESSMENT:

   🧠 Are timeframes aligned or divergent? Which dominates?

2. TECHNICAL INDICATORS:
   Analyze all provided Momentum, Trend, Volatility, and Volume indicators (RSI, MACD, ADX, ATR, ROC, MFI, etc.)
   🧠 Do indicators confirm each other or show divergence?

3. PATTERN RECOGNITION (Conservative Approach):
   **Swing Structure:** HH/HL = uptrend, LH/LL = downtrend | **Classic:** H&S, double tops/bottoms, wedges, flags | **Candlesticks:** doji, hammer, engulfing at key S/R | **Divergences:** Price vs RSI/MACD/OBV | **IMPORTANT:** If unclear, state "No clear pattern" - do NOT force conclusions
   🧠 Is pattern complete or forming? Could this be a fakeout?

4. SUPPORT/RESISTANCE:
   Key levels across timeframes | Historical reaction zones (3+ touches) | Confluences (S/R + Fib + SMA) | Volume nodes | Risk/reward for SL/TP
   🧠 How did price react last time at this level?
